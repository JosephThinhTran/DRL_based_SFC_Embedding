# DRL_based_SFC_Embedding
 DRL-based algorithms for solving SFC Embedding Problems

# Implemented Algorithms
 ## A2C-based SFC embedding
    - Apply Advantage Actor-Critic DRL algorithm to solve the SFC embedding problem
	- Run "AC_SFC_Main_01.05.py" for training/testing the A2C RL-agent

 ## DQN-based SFC embedding
    - Apply DQN RL algorithm to solve the SFC embedding problem
	- Run "DQ_SFC_Main_01.08.py" for training the DQN RL-agent
	- Run "test_model_random_req_order_v01.08.py" for testing the DQN RL-agent

# Dataset
 - Using the Dataset created by Huy Duong in the Ciena SOF-WP1 Project
